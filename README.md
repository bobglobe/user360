##Goal

Create an “enriched_purchase” table with the following schema so that we can train vectorize & train without doing expensive joins

Cf `enriched_purchases.json`


##Input
Purchase table (cf `purchase.json`)
1 file / day




##Current approach and its limit

Asset is build on the fly with very expensive joins going back 24 months of purchase data


##New potential approach

Build incrementally an enriched_user asset that will include in an array all past purchases until today
That way, this enriched_purchase$20200305 can be easily created on the fly by joining the last partition of purchases$20200305 with enriched_user$20200305....With clustering added. This could be a much cheaper approach


##current query

```
#standardSQL
WITH
  purchases_array_0302 AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    DATE('2020-03-02') AS dat,
    ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(sku,
        date,
        quantity,
        purchase_price ) ) AS past_purchases
  FROM
    `sandbox-airflow-test.bq_structure.purchases`
  WHERE
    (date = '2020-03-01'
      OR date='2020-03-02')
  GROUP BY
    user_id
  ORDER BY
    dat ASC ),
  todays_purchases AS (
  SELECT

    DATE('2020-03-03') AS dat,
    ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(sku,
